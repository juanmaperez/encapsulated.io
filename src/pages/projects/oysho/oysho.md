Oysho is a Spanish company that belongs to Inditex Group. Oysho is specialized in female underwear. The headquarter are based in Tordera, 65km from Barcelona where they have magnificent facilities for their employers.

As a part of their team, I was working on different themes for showing their products on the main website. Catalogs for different campaigns created by the design team and makes real through HTML, CSS and Javascript code. Other functions that I had to develop were different behaviors that interacted with users during the navigation.

An important task to implement in Oysho was to improve the productivity with internal tools. For reach this end, I was the responsible to create a script for the automation of the content published on the website. This script allowed us to build the homepage dynamically including all the different sliders and the information displayed.
